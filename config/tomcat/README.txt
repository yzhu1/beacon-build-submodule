The files in this directory are deployed as-is to tomcat's conf/
directory, both in development environments on people's
workstations, as well as in RPMs and RPM deployments. We don't yet
have a notion of per-environment configuration of Tomcat, and I'm
hoping that we won't need to (or that we can easily add it).
